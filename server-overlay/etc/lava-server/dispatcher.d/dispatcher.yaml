# Configuration example
# Each dispatcher might have a configuration file like this one.
# Use the fully qualified hostname of the worker as the filename,
# as shown in the lava-master logs, and create the file in
# /etc/lava-server/dispatcher.d on the *master*.

# Only set this key, if this dispatcher has many IPs
dispatcher_ip: 192.168.19.2

# Set this key, if you want to change the default lxc creation path
# No trailing /
# The default path is /var/lib/lxc
#lxc_path: <custom-path>

# Prefix for all temporary directories
# If this variable is set, the temporary files will be created in
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<prefix><job_id> instead of
# /var/lib/lava/dispatcher/tmp/<job_id>
# prefix: <prefix>
